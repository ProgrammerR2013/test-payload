# test-payload
This is a test payload made in PowerShell for penetration testing purposes.

So basically, when you add this payload with your exploit (PowerShell exploit), then the target mainframe will show a dialogue box saying, "This is a test payload".

It's a pretty basic code that did not even take 20 minutes to create. Email me at nalawaderudra1@gmail.com for more suggestions to create tools and other softwares.
